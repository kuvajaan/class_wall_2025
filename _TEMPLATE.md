**My favorite tech:** Having screen time from 14 to sometimes 16hours, I would like to say it's my phone.

**My goal for this course:** Don’t want to scare anyone with being this serious, but for a long time I want to contribute myself to the health field, even though not getting good grades I didn’t get the chance to do so, and also not getting jobs in the field. Having some knowledge in the health field now I am planning if this course will help me fixing my goals and contribute it in the health related field. By doing some research, I am quite fond of AI in health care. So i want to now stick with this goal and do something after finishing this course with my goal.
**A fun fact:** at this age still haven’t figured out what I really want to do, so I finally made a decision to take this course.
