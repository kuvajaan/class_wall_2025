**My favorite tech: tamagochi** (e.g. a programming language, gadget or technology)

**My goal for this course: not feel so lost :,)** (e.g. to learn Linux, see a robot)

**A fun fact: I sew and build cosplays** (e.g. I once solved the rubrik's cube under 60 seconds, I was once reincarnated as a slime)
